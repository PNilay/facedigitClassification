# facedigitClassification
This project is based on the project created by Dan Klein and JohnNero that was given as part of programming assignment of Berkely's CS188 course.
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp11/projects/classification/classification.html

This project implemented two classification algorithm for detecting faces and classifying digits:
* Perceptron  
The Perceptron is a single layer neural network, modern deep neural networks are nothing but perceptron stacked on top of each other. Perceptron is a linear classifer,which means it makes predictions about image based on a linear decision function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

* Naive Bayes Classifier  
Naive Bayes classier algorithm is based on probabilistic classiers, which means this algorithms uses probabilities determined
from training data. It also uses Bayes therom with naive assumptions between the features.
